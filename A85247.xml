         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170052:4"/>of decaying Holineſs; by the one ſhe is defended from ſuffering ill, by the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in doing well.

If ever kneeling were in ſeaſon, now is the needfull time, when there is not onely wrath gone out from the Lord againſt us, but even the blood, Vialls of his fierceſt wrath are daily powred down upon us. I willingly confeſs my ſelf to have been too deep a ſharer in thoſe grievous ſins, which have inforced theſe heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; what I cannot recall, I deſire hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to bewail, and (as a true ſigne of mine unfeigned ſorrow) according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of my weak abilities, have penn'd theſe following lines: accept of them I beſeech you, as humbly devoted to your honors ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and read them as the diſturbed noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:170052:4"/>of my diſtracted meditations. That ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Providence which hath directed their ends, will (I truſt) ſupply their defects; even this the leaſt of graines (by that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) may become a fruitfull tree, and branch it ſelf into matter of commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the learned, of inſtruction to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, of help to the weak, of comfort to the willing, of joy to the good, of terror to the bad, of happineſs (I truſt) to all that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to it, and eſpecially unto their ſoules that ſtand in greateſt need of comfort from it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not preſume to inlarge my ſelf with waſt expreſſions, becauſe I know your Lordſhips more weightie affairs will not admit of ſuch fruitleſs indeavours; I ſhall now onely crave your Honors leave, to end with <hi>Oriſons;</hi> as you have been both holy in your lives, ſo may you be happy in your deaths, bleſſed in your memorialls; may thoſe hopefull pledges of your loves be faithfull earneſts of your joyes, and future branches of the Churches Peace; may they all (by your examples) go on cheerfully, and joyfully, in thoſe pathes of Piety which lead to reſt and quietneſs, that their ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time being ſorrow, their harveſt may be joy, that all tears may be wip'd from their

            <p>Such humble Confeſſions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Prayers, as (by Gods mercy) I have found agreeable to mine own condition, I have here publiſhed for the good of thine; and ſuch true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as I have enjoyed in them, I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſire may be derived to thee from them: And my humble and moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt petition unto Almightie God is, that as wee have been deep ſharers in

                  </gap>o Lord a moſt pure, ſimple, and eternall beeing; Pure without matter, without form; Simple without mixture, without compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; Eternall, without beginning, without end: no Created being can expreſs thee, no imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation conceive thee, no underſtanding utter thee: when I think of thee as thou art, the bright beames of thy glory amaze mee; when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of thee what thou art not, the terrors of mine own heart affright mee; even but the Leaſt thought of this kind is impious, ſeeing that hereby I do not onely rob thee of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but even deprive thee of thy ſelf: and yet Lord, as thy being is moſt high, ſo is the ſearch thereof moſt neceſſary, becauſe from it (as from the bleſſed fountain) I enjoy my preſent, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect my future happineſs; and unto it with joy of heart, and earneſtneſs of ſoul, I deſire ſhould run the current of my praiſes in this life, of my Allelujaes in that to come.</p>
               <p>When I find (therefore) any Corporall parts appropriated to the Divine nature, I there ſee thee gratiouſly deſcending to the weakneſs of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170052:11"/>my frail and infirm nature, and ever bleſs thy holy name that vouchſafeſt to declare thy ſelf, not as thou art, but as I am: Thine Eye (Lord) is thy Wiſdom, thy Right hand thy Power, thy ſitting thine Immutability, thy Standing thy Fortitude, thine Anger thy Juſtice in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, thy Repentance thy Mercy in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thy Hatred of ſin thy Holineſs, thy grieving thy Loving kindneſs, thy Patience and long ſuffering thy Goodneſs; all are thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>Neither is it enough for me to conſider the Divine nature in Unitie of Eſſence, unleſs I go yet further and find a Trinity of Perſons; to be curious in this ſearch is dangerous, to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs damnable; nothing may be here ſafely ſeen, but what is gratiouſly revealed: Lord no man can ſee thee as thou art in thy ſelf, ſuffer mee therefore to ſee thee as thou art unto us, that I may know thee, and love thee, and delight in thee, and be for ever known and loved of thee.</p>
               <p>If there were not an eternity of being, then it may be truly ſaid that not being was before being, and ſo that being had its riſe from-not being, by cauſing it ſelf to be when it was not; So ſhould Privation which was eternally evill, produce that glorious being which is eternally good: Seeing this cannot be, it will hence follow, that being was from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that this being was eternally Good; for that which was good in the effect, muſt needs be far more eminently good in the cauſe. That this eternall good being muſt be alſo infinite, becauſe eternity it ſelf is infinite; That this infinite eternall good being, muſt be of infinite power, to continue infinitely; That this infinite power muſt alſo bee of infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to ſupport and preſerve this eternall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170052:11"/>infintie good beeing; and this infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is God.</p>
               <p>Where there is an infinite underſtanding, there muſt alſo be an infinite object to be underſtood, els could it not be inſinitely active, and ſo ſhould both eternity and infinitie ſuffer diminution and become defective, which were for them both to be and not to be, which is impoſſible; and ſeeing there can be no object infinite out of God; therefore this eternall infinite and ever-bleſſed object, muſt of neceſſity be God.</p>
               <p>Where there is an infinite underſtanding, and an infinite object to be underſtood, there cannot chooſe but be an infinite and eternall love; for from this infinite Underſtanding of this infinitely amiable and for ever bleſſed object, there muſt needs proceed an infinite delight, whereby it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely injoyeth its own excellency, and eternally reflecteth on the beauty of its own perfection; els this infinite eternall underſtanding ſhould want power to enjoy this infinitely aimiable object, and ſo ſhould be neither good, infinite, nor eternall; and this infinite and eternall love is God.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe this Underſtanding, Object, and Love are all infinite, and that whatſoever is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite muſt of neceſſity be God; it will from thence truly and undoubtedly follow, that this underſtanding is God, this Object God, and this Love God. And becauſe it is as equally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that there can be any more than one infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, therefore it will as aſſuredly follow that theſe three are one, three in Exiſtence, one in Eſſence, three in Order, one in Eternity; three perſons, one eternall, infinite, glorious, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, wiſe God; to whom be glory for ever.

               <p>This is that bleſſed Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, that ineffable, moſt myſterious Trinity in Unity, eternally injoying bleſſedneſs in its own Eſſence; This is that bleſſed inter-union of that ever bleſſed Spirit, that moſt unſpeakable, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, incomprehenſible fruition of eternall joy, at which the bleſſed Angells ſtand amazed, in which the bleſſed Saints ſhall ſweetly reſt themſelves for ever.</p>
               <p>All this, and infinitely more than this, thou art Lord in thy ſelf, thy Wiſdom, Juſtice, Mercy, Truth, Power, Holineſs, and whatſoever other Attributes thou art pleas'd to take unto thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence, are unto thee one, although unto us divers; and thou art therefore pleaſed diverſly to manifeſt thy ſelf unto us, becauſe we cannot otherwiſe conceive thy being, than according to thine outward working; thy diſtinct operations are unto us the divers Indications of thine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, undivided, and for ever bleſſed eſſence.</p>
               <p>And now Lord, who can ſee thee thus and live? I have hitherto ſeen nothing but deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to my body, amazement to my ſoul: In thine Eſſence there is light inacceſſible, unto which no mortall eye can approach; in thine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes terror unutterable, from which no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man can eſcape: Thy wiſdom trying my corrupt heart, and ſcoarching my ſinfull reines; Thy Juſtice moſt ſevere, fearfull in the pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, dreadfull in the execution; Thy truth admitteth of no alteration; no Judgement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced but preciſely fullfilled; Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but not one tittle of thy ſacred word; Thy Holineſs is ſuch, that even the bleſſed Angells are impute in thy ſight; what then ſhall become of me a miſerable wretch, the thoughts of whoſe heart are only evill, and that

               <p>I can here with joy unſpeakable and glorious, behold thee my loving Father affectionately imbracing me in Chriſt from all eternity, by the ſweet working of thy holy Spirit; this is that truly-bleſſed viſion of the ſacred and myſterious Trinity in this life of Grace, that will for ever make me truly happy in that of Glory. Lord, if I find thee not Three in One to my ſoul's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in this life, I ſhall never be found of thee to be bleſſed in thee in that to come.</p>
               <p>Without thy Power it had not been decreed, without thy Wiſdom it had never been acted, without thy Love it had never been ſiniſhed: Here in a ſevere Judge I joyfully behold a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Redeemer; In a glorious Divinity a true Humanity, united to the Deity, not mixed with it; Before I had three Perſons in one Eſſence, here I have two Natures in one Perſon, God and Man, one Chriſt, in whom, and by whom, I have a joyfull intereſt and undoubted union in the Godhead. Here is the Father promiſing, the Son performing, the Holy Spirit confirming. This is alone that bleſſed ſight of God, that bringeth reſt and quietneſs to my weary ſoul: To know him to be my God, to have ſuffered for my ſin, and riſen again for my Juſtification. To find him ſupporting, ſuſtaining me in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmaties, relieving my wants, chaſtiſing my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, revenging my wrongs, repairing my breaches, directing my wayes, protecting my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; wounding, rending, breaking my obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heart; creating in me a clean heart, and renewing a right Spirit within me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning,

                  <hi>Bleſſed God,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHen I conſider of the richneſs, of the largeneſs, of the conſtancy of thy love to man, of mans vileneſs and untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto thee his God, I ſtand amazed at thy goodneſs, and mine own unthankfulneſs. How great, and invaluable a bleſſinge do I enjoy in being made partaker of the glorious light of this preſent day? how vile and unworthy am I that receive it? how great and glorious art thou that giveſt it? Thou, O Lord, art light inacceſſible, unto which no mortall eye can approach; before whoſe glorious Majeſty the bleſſed Angels ſtand amazed; and I am duſt and aſhes, yea worſe, Lord, (for duſt was thy creation, and therefore in its entity was good) before I was duſt I was not at all: This not being, by thee became a being, this being beautifull, this beauty immortall; and without thee this happy being is again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come far worſe than not to be.</p>
               <p>What can be more vain, more empty than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? ah wo is me, I am now become far worſe than nothing; thou madſt me all goodneſs, and that goodneſs might have made me all bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but I have made my ſelf all ſin, and this ſin hath made me all miſery; there was darkneſs in not being, but that darkneſs was incapable, there is greater darkneſs in being ill; for this darkneſs is moſt capable of the privation of all light of comfort in this life, of the fruition of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170052:14"/>the blackneſs of darkneſs in hell for ever.</p>
               <p>This, Lord, was my condition in nature, and without thy gracious help muſt have been ſo for ever. Let me now ſee what my condition is by Grace, by which I enjoy not only the light of nature (without which my life would prove uncomfortable) but allſo a ſweet and ſafe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that thou wilt by this happy light conduct me ſafely to the bleſſed light of Glory.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed Lord, I can now look no way but to happineſs, I now find a true ſweetneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs of ſoul, a conſtant and courageous ſetledneſs of heart, even in the very heighth of all the diſturbances of Nature, of all the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Sin, of all the fluctuations of Sorrow, of all the Machinations of Satan: from the ſweet fountain of thy mercy, ariſe thoſe pretious ſtreames of Conſolation, which aboundantly relieve mee in this barren wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>I find indeed a law in my members, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually rebelling againſt the law of my mind, but I find alſo thy grace to bee ſufficient for mee, by which I am victorious here, and ſhallbe triumphant hereafter: Satan may ſtrive to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now mee like wheat, but this ſhall make mee the purer for thy Granary. I now find a totall and a bleſſed change of the whole man; mine affections which formerly were captivated unto ſin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to thy ſervice; my love with holy <hi>David</hi> wonderfull to thy law, my hatred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect againſt ſin, my deſire eager for thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, my fear aſtoniſhing in thine abſence, my delight in thy promiſes raviſhing, my joy in thy performances triumphing.</p>
               <p>By theſe rich indowments of thine I am wrapt up above the reach of humane miſery; all vain and empty deſires of the beſotting pleaſures of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170052:14"/>this life appear truly as they are, but thornes and bryars, to diſturb the growth of my felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; how ſweet is their loſs for thy gain? how eaſily, how willingly, how joyfully, how thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, are all theſe foggy miſts of ignorance and error happily diſperſt, by the bright rayes of my enſuing glory.</p>
               <p>Beſide theſe fawning enemies of Peace which flatter to unquietneſs, I am now able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with thoſe other which affright the ſoul even in their firſt appearance, and are able to deject the carnall man even to aſtoniſhment, and utterly to expoſe him to the tyranny of ſin, and torture of puniſhment: ſuch Lord is the vaſt difference between the bleſſed ones of thy fold, and thoſe unhappy ones which ſtray from thee into the ſtrange paſtures of impiety.</p>
               <p>No ſorrow can ſurprize mee but for ſin, and even this too thou makeſt to increaſe my joy: what affliction can be evil which is thy phyſick who art the fountain of all good? if it be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in the taſt, it is joyous in the effects; If I mark the happy cloſe, I muſt with joy confeſs, that theſe bitter ſtorms wil end in bleſſed calms, will bring to my remembrance thoſe grievous ſinns that brought my Saviour to thoſe bitter groanes, will force mee from the ſorrowes of this life, to my Celeſtiall harbour, will bring mee on my knees to ſee mine own vildneſs, will inrich mee with the graces of humilitie, and patience, and together with them the ſweet injoyments of thy bleſſed Spirit; and if ſo, how can I complain of want, when in ſtead of earth I enjoy heaven?</p>
               <p>Lord, what can he fear that is aſſured of thy favour? afflictions, tribulations, croſſes, ſinns, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Death, hell it ſelf ſhall work to mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: as my croſs is more grievous, my crown
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170052:15"/>ſhall be more glorious; where ſin and Satan have been moſt prevailing, there Grace and Goodneſs ſhallbe more triumphing. How truly ſweet Lord is the inviolable peace of thy ſaints? who powerfully compelleſt even the very rage of earth and hell to work to their advantage. Lord ſanctifie the trialls of this life unto my ſinfull ſoul, that by my patient ſufferings with my Saviour here, I may have peace with him and by him hereafter.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto looked on mine inward hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; if I now caſt mine eyes upon mine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I ſhall there ſee that all theſe outward bleſſings allſo are moſt peculiarly belonging to the Saints; the wicked ones of the world are robbers, and ſhall one day give an account of their theft; children, friends, ſtrangers, even our very enemies, are protected, preſerved, inriched, bleſſed for our ſakes; ſo was <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for <hi>Jacob, Zoar</hi> for <hi>Lot, Potipher</hi> for <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Centurion and ſouldiers for St <hi>Paul:</hi> And if thou (Lord) wilt look ſo lovingly upon the children of this world for thine elect ſake, how gratiouſly wilt thou one day look upon thoſe ſonnes that ſhall be made partakers of thine own inheritance?</p>
               <p>Who would not now bee holy? ſeeing that in this bleſſed condition, there is not only ſafety inviolable, but peace untterable, ſafety in life, and ſweetneſs in death.</p>
               <p>And now Lord, when I enquire for what cauſe thou giveſt me all this, I find nothing but thy meer love unto me; when I ask what thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt for all this, I hear thee demand no thing but the return of love: what is more eaſy, what more ſweet than love? and what object more aimable than that glorious being that is the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170052:15"/>perfection of al love, &amp; that love the beauty of al perfection? Thou canſt not give Lord what thou haſt not, the glory of thy creation is but a glimps of that grater glory of thine eſſence; Lord who can deny thee Love? how ſweet is this yoak, how light this burden! when I love thee I enjoy thee, and my ſelf in thee, I poſſeſs thee, I reſt in thee for ever. O my God, all that thou giveſt mee, all that thou requireſt of mee, is to make mee happy, to thee be glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>WHen I call to mind how many daies have paſt me without bending of a knee, how many nights I have gone prayerleſs to bed, I may well wonder that I am this hour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to ſpeak unto thee: I have been too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of thy holy providence, and am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore utterly unworthy of thy mercifull protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Few, and full of evill have my dayes been in the houſe of my pilgrimage, I know not how ſoon I may goe hence, and yet I ſtill live as if I knew not why I came hither.</p>
               <p>I am many wayes invited to my heavenly home; how ſweetly doeſt thou wean from the miſeries of life, by the bleſſedneſs of death! By this Evenings reſt of my body I am put in mind of that eternall reſt of my ſoul: This dayes ending tells me that the end of all things is at hand, that the faſhion of this world paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and that all things ſhall become new: As
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170052:18"/>this hour is the Evening to this day, ſo this day (for ought I know) may be the Evening to my whole life; I cannot challenge to my ſelf one minute more; how vain am I to promiſe dayes and years? Lord, in the whole current of thy Sacred Story I find but onely one, that durſt preſume upon ſo large a reckoning, and him thou brandeſt with the name of Fool: Let his folly (Lord) be my inſtruction, ſo ſhall I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count each day my laſt, and neither care to live, nor fear to dye.</p>
               <p>How many have been ſnacht out of this life, how ſuddenly, and to mans eye how fearfully? How unſpeakable is thy mercy unto me to ſpare me for repentonce? how often and how earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſt thou invited me to mercy how coldly and how careleſly have I refuſed theſe thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious offers? ſtill I ſin, and ſtill thou forgiveſt, and (which is the height of my impiety) I therefore am more and more evill againſt thee, becauſe thou art more and more gracious unto me; and it were now moſt juſt with thee, even this very moment, to put a period to my ſinfull life.</p>
               <p>Lord, Let this teach me to improve the ſhort remnant of my dayes to thy ſervice, and that I may endeavour ſo to doe, I will preſcribe my ſelf theſe following rules.</p>
               <p>Each evening ſhall take a ſtrict account of that dayes traffique for my ſoul, and where I find my ſelf a loſer, I will labour for ſupply. When I awake, my firſt thoughts ſhall begin with thee, from whom I have my firſt being: Nothing will more truly repreſent me to my ſelf, than the firſt view of mine affections; if my firſt thoughts be ſeaſoned with grace, my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing actions will ſavour of goodneſs. My
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170052:18"/>care ſhall be more to dreſs my ſoul, than to trim my body; I will think no pains too great, no ornaments too rich to make her beautifull. One devout ſigh from a contrite heart, is of more worth (in thy ſight) than an hours task of Lip-devotion. My affections are the ſoul of my words, without which, I ſpeak onely, but pray not: when my prayers are cold, my hopes may well be comfortleſs. My ſet hours for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion ſhall be conſtant; no pretence of nature ſhall debar me of this happineſs: The Lovers eyes are often glancing on the pleaſing object that delights him; if my affections be ſincere, my looks will be amorous, I ſhall often ſteal a ſweet Ejaculation to ſatisfie the longing of my Love-ſick ſoul. When I can thus bring the day to an end, my life will be comfortable, my death happy, and I may then ſay with holy <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>I will lay me down in peace, and take my reſt, for it is thou Lord onely that makeſt me dwel in ſafety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bleſſed Lord, in the morning of my Creation thou gaveſt me unto my ſelf, in the evening of my Redemption thou gaveſt thy ſelf unto me: My Creation was wonderfull, my Redemption aſtoniſhing.

               <p>THere is no mortall man worthy to ſtand at thy door, much leſs to appear in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and yet how often have I preſumed to approach unto thee without that prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, without that dejection of ſoul, without that true and holy reverence that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh thy child.</p>
               <p>I am now going out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> out of Bondage into Freedom: The ſinfull troubles
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170052:19"/>of this life are my ſouls Taskmaſters, to load it with a burthen inſupportable, and this is that place of ſacrifiſe, that Mount of God, to eaſe and ſolace it.</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore, O my ſoul, in what relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thou now ſtandeſt to thy God: If thou art a true Iſraelite, thou wilt look back upon thy drudgery, and deſpiſe it, and offer up thy ſelf a living ſacrifice with cheerfulneſs, with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart. If thou art Gods child, thou wilt love to be in Gods houſe; Long for Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, thirſt for his favour, delight in his Word, and rejoyce to be often at his Table: Thou wilt make it thy chieſeſt joy to be often in that place, from whence thou mayſt expect thy chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good.</p>
               <p>Lord (by thy grace aſſiſting) I will now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath my ſelf of all earthly affections, I will call to mind unto whoſe preſence I approach, and wherefore; that I am going from this Church Militant, to that Triumphant; that thou, Lord, art as truly preſent here in Grace, as there in Glory (unleſs therefore I am in love with miſery) I will leave behind me all earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs, and carry with me a pure heart, and heavenly thoughts, a lowly mind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend geſture. Lord, if I go not cheerfully to thy Throne of Grace, I may well fear I ſhall never go joyfully to that of Glory.</p>
               <p>The loweſt room in thy Houſe ſhall content me, Divine Worſhip admitteth not of diſparity of perſons; we are all ſinners, and (as we are in nature) moſt impure in thy ſight, the worſt room in thy Houſe is too good even for the beſt of us, yet decency of place may be taken with modeſty, if not ſought with emulation.</p>
               <p>During the time of this holy diſpenſation, I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170052:20"/>will call my thoughts unto a ſtrict attendance; and make it part of my precedent prayer, that I may. Satan is ever moſt buſie, when our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are moſt holy; which when he cannot divert, he labours to corrupt, and by this means when I deſire to grow better, I become worſe. How carefull ought I to be to avoyd his cunning, who can couzen me in my beſt actions?</p>
               <p>My ſoul ſhall more delight it ſelf with the matter, than my ears with the melody of thy ſacred Notes: Church-muſick will be then tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweet unto me, when mine outward joy is ſubſervient to mine inward.</p>
               <p>Mans ſinfull weakneſs ſhall not make me ſlight thy holy Ordinance: If my Paſtor have failings, I will pity, and pray for him, but not deſpiſe him. If I look into mine own ſoul, I ſhall there find work enough to repair mine own ruins. This, Lord, ſhall rather move me to extoll thy mercy, in upholding mine own ſteps, to lament the ſadneſs of my Brothers mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Lord, let me never think my ſelf better than another, becauſe I know not how ſoon I may become worſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall willingly continue in that Fold where thou haſt placed me, and hope to remain there with comfort, till thou ſhalt lead me out with ſafety. While I am at thy feeding, I am happy; one of thy morſels well digeſted with humility and thankfulneſs, will yeeld me better nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than that other food of mine own finding. The very meaneſt of thy Miniſters may afford me Patience, and that heavenly Grace, with thy bleſſing to boot, is a great advantage. If I receive thy Sacred Word with cheerfulneſs, with earneſtneſs of heart, my obedience ſhall be accepted, my zeal rewarded.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:170052:20"/>
               <p>While I am within thy walls, I ſhall account that geſture moſt decent that is moſt humble, and thoſe ceremonies moſt neceſſary that are moſt ſuitable to obedience; all matters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (which are neceſſary to ſalvation) ought to be guided by thy ſacred Word, which is the onely rule of faith; all matters of Diſcipline, (which are neceſſary onely to obedience) are therefore left to thy Churches care: that as thou art one, ſo thy Church may be one, in that bleſſed union of love; which is the bond of peace.</p>

               <p>Lord, wilt thou ſtill ſuffer me to abuſe thy goodneſſe? How long Lord, how long ſhall I wander in theſe wofull waies of wickedneſſe? I am weary of the ſins and miſeries of this life, and willing to embrace this heavenly comfort for my ſoul. I confeſſe my ſelf a great and grievous ſinner, and yet I know Lord, thou cameſt not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance: I am hungry, and poor, and blind, and naked, and miſerable, deſtitute of all hope, of all help, but from thee alone; Lord I am unworthy of thy crums, yet thou admitteſt me to thy Table; the ſinfulneſſe of my corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made a wofull ſeparation between us, but the richneſſe of thy ſufferings hath for ever made a ſweet conjunction of us; all my ſins are thine, all thy righteouſneſſe is mine, thou art now my well-beloved, and I am thy choſen one, and in this bleſſed Union is my ſweet and ſafe repoſe for ever.</p>

               <p>Lord how unworthy am I of theſe embraces, if I bewail not, if I abhor not, if I forſake not all the wretched failings of my ſinfull life paſt; if I rejoyce not with joy unſpeakable, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to be admitted to ſo great a mercy; if this inflame not mine affections with unſpotted love to thee my God, with earneſt longings for thy preſence of Grace in this life, of Glory in that to come?</p>

               </head>
               <p>ALaſs, my Soul, how vain art thou, how wretched, to preſume upon the mercy of thy God? how canſt thou be ſo fooliſh to believe, that God will favour thee in that, which he ſo ſeverely puniſhed in his own Son? thinkeſt thou that pretious bloud was ſpilt to cheriſh ſin? Be not miſtaken, for as Chriſt Ieſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, ſo he came allſo to call ſinners to repentance. Doeſt thou argue well to ſay, becauſe God is mercifull, long-ſuffering, and of great goodneſſe, therefore I will abuſe his mercy in ſinning, his patience by my long continuing in ſin, his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by my great unthankfulneſſe? is not this to mock his mercy, to bid defiance to his juſtice, to arm him with fury, to invite him to revenge? Aſſure thy ſelf, the longer he is in drawing his Bow, the more forcible will he ſend his Arrow.</p>
               <p>Deceive not thy ſelf therefore, God will not be ſo mercifull to thee, as to be unjuſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; All the waies of God are Mercy and Truth; Mercy to ſupport thy weakneſſe, Truth to correct thy wilfulneſſe: There is therefore Mercy with him, that he may be feared, not that he may be ſlighted, not that he may be ſhamefully diſhonoured. How full of falſhood is thy bold preſumption? thou crieſt Peace, Peace, when ſudden War is ready to deſtroy thee; <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God;</hi> Heaven and Earth are up in Arms againſt

               <p>O remember, that the Angels, for one ſin, were thrown down from Heaven, and that <hi>Adam,</hi> for one ſin, was caſt out of Paradiſe: Thy ſins (O my Soul) are innumerable, thou haſt had line upon line, and precept upon precept, and yet thou addeſt ſin upon ſin, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion upon tranſgreſſion: Thou haſt ſinned againſt many pretious promiſes, againſt many gratious performances, againſt many fearfull judgements; thou haſt grieved that good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which the Saints are ſealed up unto the day of redemption: All theſe are heavy aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon thee, to fill up the meaſure of thy ſins, and haſten the ſwiftneſſe of thy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Ah how ſad is thy condition! thou haſt not onely wearied out thy ſelf in wickedneſſe, but thy God allſo: hear what he faith unto thee, how he complaineth of thee, by his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Behold, I am preſſed under you, as a cart is laden with ſheaves, Amos</hi> 2.13. and yet thou ſtill addeſt more load: but as thou addeſt ſin upon ſin, ſo thou calleſt for wrath upon wrath; as thou haſt made a mock at ſin, ſo God will make a mock at miſery; as thou haſt thy meaſure in ſinning, ſo God will have his meaſure in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Conſider what he ſaith unto thee by his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170052:30"/>Prophet, <hi>Judgement will I lay to the rule, and Righteouſneſſe to the ballance, Eſay</hi> 28.17, 18. As he hath a bottle for thy tears, ſo he hath a bag for thy tranſgreſſions, <hi>Job</hi> 14.17. their growth is recorded, their number accounted, their nature examined, all ſealed up againſt the great and fearfull day of the revelation of the righteous judgement.</p>
               <p>O conſider this thou that forgetteſt God, leſt he tear thee in pieces, and there be none to deliver thee: Think how ſuddenly thou mayſt be ſnatcht away by thoſe infernall Fiends, to endleſſe torments, and then what tears will be enough to weep thine obſequies, to quench thoſe everlaſting burnings? But then, alaſs, inſtead of tears of compaſſion, thou ſhalt have mocks of deriſion, the curſed Devils will laugh thee to ſcorn, the bleſſed Saints and Angels will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at thy confuſion, and God himſelf, who onely can relieve thee, will for ever hide his tender mercy from thee.</p>
               <p>Awake therefore out of thy ſleep of death, look well into thy loſt eſtate, thou art now near unto making up the meaſure of thy ſins, beyond which thou canſt not paſſe: Thy God hath ſaid to thee, as to the Sea, hitherto malt thou goe, and here ſhalt thou ſtay thy proud waves: Think how ſuddenly thou mayeſt be called to thy laſt account, even this very hour, (for ought thou knoweſt) thoſe curſed Spirits may convey thee to thy fiery Priſon: O think how powerfully the wrath of God will then ſeize upon thee; how wofully thou wilt excrutiate thy ſelf, with apprehenſion of thy former folly; and laſt of all, how wretchedly thou art for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever baniſht from eternall joyes, to ſuffer with the damned in eternall torments: L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>COnſider, O my ſoul, from whence theſe happy thoughts ariſe, and wherefore, if they were from nature, they muſt needs ſavour of corruption, but now they are from Grace, they ſummon thee to goodneſs, they beckon thee to immortality: Thy God now calleth thee to repentance; he offers thee his gracious pardon for thy ſin; his love, his protection, his peace, his grace, his glory: He now woeth thee to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and thou (a wofull wretch) convicted by thine own accuſing conſcience, condemned by divine Juſtice, rebelliouſly rejecteſt all theſe gracious offers: Ah, what wofull folly is this! nay rather what wilfull madneſs! As there is a time of calling, ſo there will be a time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting; the bleſſed wind of Gods holy Spirit bloweth but where it liſteth; when it is once gone, thou knoweſt not whether it ſhall ever return: <hi>God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. 9. Ah wo be unto that ſoul whoſe time of calling is once paſt, a thouſand worlds cannot redeem its loſs. If thou wilt not now embrace theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable breathings of his tender love, thou ſhalt then endure the bitter ſtorms of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed wrath.</p>
               <p>If thou wilt not embrace his Mercy, thou ſhalt exalt his Juſtice: <hi>I called unto you</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and yee refuſed to come, I held out my hand and ye would not look towards me; therefore will I forſake you in your extremity, when your fear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>Gods clemency and patience in this life will aſſuredly exaſperate his fury, and revenge, in that to come; as his Mercy is unutterable, ſo his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is intollerable, both are his divine being, and therefore both muſt needs be infinite; both are to manifeſt his glory, and therefore both muſt be eternall.</p>
               <p>From hence is that expreſſion of Saint <hi>Vaul, It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> Heb. 10. From hence it is that wicked men are left unto their own ſwing in this life, that they may be payd home with Gods wrath in that to come.</p>
               <p>Let this teach thee, O my ſoul, to welcome theſe endeared motions of the gladding Spirit, to thirſt for them, to rejoyce in them, to think no thought too dear to be diſloged for them.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed Lord, I hear thee calling thy holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and I ſee him readily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking all to follow thee; how often haſt thou called me, a ſinfull wretch, by the ſweet moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy bleſſed Spirit; and I have hitherto refuſed to forſake the very leaſt of all my ſins, for thy ſake, who willingly forſookeſt all the pleaſures of this life for mine? Long haſt thou waited my repentance, but I have yet hated to be reformed. Mercy hath been offered, and I have not eſteemed it, Judgement hath been threatned, and I have not regarded it; thou haſt not onely whiſpered unto me by thy graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous viſits of thy bleſſed Spirit, but thou haſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

All this my ſins have juſtly brought upon me, and yet for all this, my wretched heart deſires to be a ſtranger to thee.</p>
               <p>Lord, who am I that thou ſo graciouſly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt unto mercy? Lord, what am I that now preſume to ſpeak unto thee? I am ſo deformed, and contemptible, that mine own knowledge cometh far ſhort of mine own miſery. O how juſtly mightſt thou for ever leave me to my ſelf, to eat the fruit of mine own wayes, and to be filled with the falſhood of mine own devices, to poſſeſs ſorrow, and inherit ſhame? But thou, O Lord, who art infinite in goodneſs, haſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to my ſinfull ſoul, that when I wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſake thee, thou readily forſakeſt all to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me; when I run from thee, thou bewaileſt me; when miſery compels me to return, thou joyfully receiveſt me, thou lovingly relieveſt me, thou then graciouſly accepteſt of me; And now, O Lord, when I have even wearied out thy mercy and compaſſion towards me, thou ſtill inviteſt me to come unto thee.</p>

                  <hi>Lord,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOthing can befall me in this life, without thy wife, and over-ruling providence; not ſo much as one hair of me can fail without thy allowance; for even my very hairs are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; as a Sparrow cannot fall to the ground, ſo neither a hair from mine head without thy ſacred leave: And if thy bleſſed Providence protecteth theſe inferior creatures, if it extend it ſelf even unto excrements, how much more ſafely doeſt thou guard the bodies, how much more tenderly the ſoules of thine Elect? Yet ſuch is my ſtupidity by nature, that I ſeldom look beyond the ſeond cauſes; I uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf with caſuals and contingencies, and often judge that meerly accidentall, which ſweetly moves by thy commands, to thine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and thy childrens good.</p>
               <p>Thy Providence is eternall, thy proviſion in time; thou, O Lord, art infinitely wiſe, and cauſt therefore provide infinitely well, the end thou ordaineſt to thy ſelf, the means to thy creature; good and bad are under thy protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the good for themſelves, the bad for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; both for thy glory; the one thou willeſt to be happy, the other thou permitteſt to be miſerable; neither of them can avoyd their neceſſity of fate, and yet thou neither inclineſt the one, nor inforceſt the other, becauſe unto both in their originall thou gaveſt perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170052:35"/>of will, to chuſe the good, to leave the bad; to inherit life, or purchaſe death.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed God, we are all debtors in our firſt Parents, thou mayſt therefore moſt juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that of us, which was lent us in them: They were able to pay, but not willing; we, their wofull poſterity (as we are in nature) are neither able, nor willing; But by thy grace, Lord, we are onely willing, and not able; and thou haſt therefore ſent thine onely Son, who was both freely willing, and fully able, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe thy Juſtice, to reconcile thy Mercy, to comfort us here, to crown us hereafter.</p>
               <p>And now, Lord, having given us thy Son, how ſhalt thou not, together with him allſo, give us all things? and yet I often ſee thee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of good things to the bad, and bad to the good: there is nothing more fiequent in this life than the afflictions of thy children, nothing more common than the proſperity of the wicked, they receive their good things in this life, I ſhall enjoy mine in that to come, when I ſhall be comforted, and they tormented. Thou, O Lord, art righteous in all they waies, and holy in all thy works; thou loadeſt them with thine outward bleſſings, for their outward obedience; thou denieſt me theſe outward favours, for mine inward advantage; by the one they are left inexcuſable; by the other I am made more conformable; my patience exerciſed, my faith tried, my love examined, my humility proved; all theſe are ſpeciall tokens of thy mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me; for as grace increaſeth here, ſo ſhall glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>Lord, what can he fear that is aſſured of thy favour? that knoweth aſſuredly, that all theſe outward things ſhall work together for the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170052:35"/>beſt, to his advantage? If <hi>Joſeph</hi> be thrown into the Pit, it is to ſend him into <hi>Egypt;</hi> if into Priſon, to preſer him to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that ſo Corn may be ſent into <hi>Canaan;</hi> if Satan be ſent to tempt <hi>Job</hi> with afflictions, it is becauſe <hi>Job</hi> ſhall overcome Satan by patience; if holy <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſad ſpectacle of humane frailty by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is to make him a pattern of true piety in repenting; if the bodies of the Saints be grievouſly martyr'd in this life, it is to array them with glorious robes in that to come.</p>
               <p>Lord, let this teach me joyfully to entertain the ſaddeſt of events, which either thy wiſdome, mans unrighteouſneſs, or Satans cruelty, can bring upon me; to be patient under them, and thankfull for them; to ranſake my ſoul, and ſearch diligently there, for what ſin thou ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt this ſorrow, to bewail it, abhor it, forſake it, and earneſtly implore thy pardon for it: When I am thus happily reſolved, I ſhall then have that undaunted boldneſſe, to ſay with holy <hi>Job, Allthough thou killeſt me, yet will I truſt in thee;</hi> with holy <hi>David, Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, yet will I fear none evill, for thou Lord art with me;</hi> and with thy bleſſed Apoſtle, that <hi>I know aſſuredly, that the ſufferings of this life ſhall work for me a far greater and more exceeding weight of glory,</hi> in that to come.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170052:39"/>ready to betray me, and diſpoyl me of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ornaments of ſoul which thou haſt given me; the cares and croſſes of this life aſflict me, the pleaſures beſot me, the profits diſturb me, pride puffeth me up, and even mine own heart deceiveth me; by calling good evill, and evill good; by making that ſweet in the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is bitter in the fruition: Lord, while I have ſought the creature, I have loſt my ſelf, my body in diſtempers, my ſoul in diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>That precious Faith which is the ground of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen, whoſe end is the ſalvation of my ſoul, which is thy gift who art the God of truth, is now drowned in a ſea of error, and juſtly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to believe dreams and deluſions, and doctrines of Devils; to truſt wholly in vanity, and to follow after lying.</p>
               <p>That ſaving knowledge, by which I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly enlightned in thy ſacred Truths, is now blinded with the ſoggy miſts of ſin and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: This, Lord, is my great aggravation, and juſt condemnation, that light is come into the world, and I have loved darkneſs better than light.</p>
               <p>That glorious hope which maketh not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but exſpecteth an inheritance eternall in the heavens, which fadeth not away, is now become a vain and empty hope, delighted with ſin, rewarded with ſhame.</p>
               <p>Thoſe bleſſed affections by which my happy ſoul was wont to walk in thy wayes, and to delight it ſelf in thy commands, are now wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out in wayes of wickedneſs; and that heart which hath ſo often promiſed obedience unto thee any thy Laws, hath now forſaken
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170052:39"/>thee the living God, and made a covenant with death and hell.</p>
               <p>Thus am I robbed and ſpoyled of all, and am become poor, and wretched, and blind, and naked, and miſerable; my whole head is ſick, and my whole heart is faint; I have ſown in iniquity, and muſt reap in aſfliction; I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated with the wine of Errour, that ſtings me like a Scrpent, and bites me like a Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, and yet when I awake (ſuch is the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my preſent condition) I ſay, I will ſeek it yet ſtill.</p>
               <p>Lord, he that is once out of thy path, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the length of his journey, and may well fear to loſe himſelf for ever.</p>
               <p>And now, Lord, what is my hope? truly my hope is even in thee; thou ſeeſt my weakneſſe, and accepteſt my willingneſſe: thou that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it impoſſible that the world ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by me, biddeſt me be of good comfort, becauſe thou (Lord) haſt overcome the world for me; if I fight not againſt thee, though I am often foyled, yet I am more than conquerour in thee.</p>
               <p>O let this teach me joyfully to rely upon thee, to make thee the height of my joy, the end of my deſires, the onely happy and eternall object of my ſinfull ſoul: Lord, I heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire thee, I thankfully embrace thee, and doe for ever vow my ſoul and body to thee.</p>
               <p>Suffer me not to wander from thy bleſſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, let me not longer dally nor diſſemble with my ſoul; O let me not think that I then love thee, when I love but my ſelf in thee; make me now at laſt to know thoſe bleſſed things that belong to my peace, leſt they be for ever hid from mine eyes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>COnſider, O my Soul, of the great danger of delaying thy repentance; of judging that ſo eaſy, which will prove ſo difficult; of thinking that allmoſt finiſht, which is ſcarce yet begun: Believeſt thou it will ſuffice thee to have ſome tranſitory thoughts of thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, to have perhaps ſome pinching ſighs, ſome ſtings of conſcience, ſome ſhews of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for thy ſins; to hang down thy head like a bulruſh for a day, and yet afterwards to return with the dog to thy filthy vomit, and with the ſow to the wallowing in the naſty mire of ſin: While thou continueſt in this courſe, thy hopes of amendment are extreme doubtfull, of reconciliation dangerous, of repentance deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>If ever thou hopeſt to inherit heaven, let not Satan thus delude thee; look well into thine evill and corrupt heart, and thou ſhalt there find, that this is not the cure, but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe of ſin; that thou grieveſt not for thine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but for thy puniſhment; that thou mayſt yet go much farther in this ſuppoſed path of thy repentance, and ſtill be far ſhort of that ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart which God requireth of thee, and yet have no part nor fellowſhip in Chriſt: Thou mayſt with <hi>Saul</hi> expreſs thy ſorrow with thy tears; with thoſe Beleevers in the Goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word with joy; with <hi>Demas,</hi> ſhew thine inward grace by thine outward obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and in ſome ſort be made partaker of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170052:47"/>Holy Ghoſt, and have a taſt of the good things of the world to come; and yet for all this, come far ſhort of this unfeigned work of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Alaſs, what can it profit thee to bewail that ſin which thou wilt not forgo? what reward canſt thou expect for that obedience which ſo ſoon fainteth? what comfort in that joy which is but temporary?</p>
               <p>Remember how great a work thou haſt in hand, how many millions of loſt ſouls complain eternally in hell of this neglect; O look into the foulneſs of thy ſin, and then into the true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy ſorrow: If thou art Gods child, thou wilt be grieved for offending of ſo good a Father; thou wilt abhor that ſin that hath ſo much provoked his diſpleaſure, thou wilt moſt ſolemnly proteſt againſt it, and ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve for ever to avoyd it; thy ſin will be ever before thee, to humble thee here, to exalt thee hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thy degrees of ſin will have thy degrees of ſorrow; thy meaſure of pollution will require thy meaſure of ſanctification: As thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up thy members to be ſervants of ſin, ſo thou muſt now yeeld them up to be weapons of righteouſneſs; as thou haſt been drowned in pleaſure, ſo thou muſt be drencht in tears; yea thoſe tears will be thy dayly food, to nouriſh thee in grace, to enrich thee in glory.</p>
               <p>O how truly-bleſſed is that ſoul, which hath unfeignedly reſolved on this good, this great, this neceſſary work? that can cheerfully and joyfully expreſs it ſelf with holy <hi>David,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Lord I am bowed down greatly, I goe mourning all the day long, I have roared out for very anguiſh and unquietneſs of heart.</hi> If thou haſt <hi>Davids</hi> ſorrow (O my ſoul) thou ſhalt aſſuredly have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170052:47"/>
                  <hi>Davids</hi> joy, thou ſhalt ſay with him allſo, <hi>Lord I am thy child, and the ſon of thine handmaid, thou haſt broken my bonds in ſunder,</hi> Pſal. 116.16. Satan may now tempt thee, and through thy frailty and infirmity prevail againſt thee; but to become a cuſtomer to evill, the powers of hell cannot entice thee; a thouſand worlds are not now of that value with thee, as the joyfull remembrance of thy paſſed dangers, thy preſent comfort, thy future ſafety.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt now ſeen (O my ſoul) how abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary this great work is; think now how happy will be the performance, how full of danger the delay: the longer thou continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in ſin, the more remote thou art from grace; What extreme folly is this in thee, to deprive thy ſelf of that friend, of whom thou haſt moſt need? If thou findeſt thy ſelf ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this holy duty now, how averſe wilt thou be hereafter, when ſin is more deeply rooted in thee, the devill in more firm poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thee, and God himſelf removed further off from thee?</p>
               <p>From whence now are theſe falſe hopes, theſe vain promiſes of future happineſs? how dareſt thou refuſe theſe gracious offers of eternity? how full of doubtfulneſs and extreme hazard is this falſe aſſurance of that holy Spirit, which thou haſt ſo often grieved? Be not deceived, God is not mocked, look what a man ſoweth, even that ſhall he reap; he that ſoweth in the fleſh, ſhall reap corruption; he that ſoweth in the Spirit, life everlaſting: If thou wilt not hear Gods call in this life, he will not hear thine in that to come; if thou wilt not mourn for thy ſins here, thou ſhalt howl for them for ever. <hi>And who ſhall then have pitty upon thee? or who
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170052:48"/>ſhall be ſorry for thee? or who ſhall pray for thy peace? thou haſt abandoned me (ſaith God) thou haſt gone from me, and now will I ſtretch out my hand againſt thee to deſtroy thee.</hi> Jerem. 15.5, 6</p>
               <p>Lord, let this teach me to deal truly with my ſelf, to ſearch narrowly for ſin, timely for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſpeedily for pardon. <hi>Seek the Lord, O my ſoul, while he may be found, for in the great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-floods</hi> (of his eternall wrath) <hi>thou ſhalt not come nigh him.</hi>

               <p>COnſider, O my ſoul, how venomous the nature of ſin is; if thou canſt afford to ſleep in ſmall ſins, thou wilt not ſtick to welcom greater. Sin is of an incroaching na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if thou ſuffer it to ſleep in thy boſom, it will expect to dwell there: Little ſins are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers to bigger ones; if thou lodgeſt theſe, thoſe will challenge entertainment: Let each evening therefore take a ſtrict accompt of that daies action, and where thou findeſt thy ſelf fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pray heartily for pardon.</p>
               <p>In thine entrance upon this holy courſe, thou wilt ſurely find three potent oppoſitions: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will tell thee, that God requireth no ſuch ſtrictneſs at thy hands; the World will tell thee, thou haſt this, or that employment to conſider of; thine own Corruption will perſwade thee, that nature will abhor this diſcontented courſe, that thy ſpirits will be too much dulled, and thy life will prove uncomfortable.</p>
               <p>Alaſs my ſoul, theſe are deluſions to betray thee to a greater miſchief. As there are degrees of Sanctification, ſo there are of Pollution; no man becometh evill in an inſtant: from hence it is, that ſometimes the ſoul can ſtart even at the very thought of that ſin, which by degrees it can digeſt without diſturbance. If holy <hi>David</hi> had accounted with his conſcience, after his luſtfull looks on <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> doubtleſs thoſe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

               <p>Lord, I now ſolemnly reſolve upon this ſafe, this ſweet, this bleſſed task; I willingly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all excuſes that may hinder me, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully embrace thoſe happy duties which invite me nearer to thy heavenly preſence; thy yoak is eaſie, and thy burthen light; when thy grace hath redeemed me from the bondage of ſin, and reſtored me into the glorious liberty of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d en, I ſhall then find (to my ſouls comfort) that thy ſervice is perfect fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> was in trouble, and it was good for him: O let not that which was good for him, be evill for me. Lord, if thy phyſick be bitter, yet it is wholſome; if it make me heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick now, it will make me healthfull hereafter; if I diſturb it not by mine impatience, it will work in me the quiet and the happy fruits of true repentance, and amendment of mine evill waies; it will remember me that I am a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and a Pilgrim here, that there is nothing in this life but wearine e and ſorrow; it will drive me from the penury of ſin, and tyranny of Satan, to the riches of grace, and liberty of goodneſſe; it will encourage me to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the richneſſe of my calling in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; it will make me willing to goe home to thee my heavenly Father, where I ſhall feel no more pain, find no more ſorrow, ſuffer no more affliction, where thou Lord wilt wipe away all tears from mine eyes, all grief from my heart.</p>
               <p>Thou (O Lord) alone knoweſt my diſeaſe, and canſt beſt temper my potion; each degree muſt be anſwered, ſo much ſinfull pleaſure as I enjoy, ſo much ſorrow muſt I drink (and woe be unto me for ever if I drink it not) if I taſt not of this cup here, I ſhall drink of the very dregs in hell: Thou, O Lord, who haſt freely forgiven me my ſins, haſt not fully remitted my puniſhments; thou who didſt undergoe the miſery of life, and the bitterneſſe of death for me, haſt neither bought off the one, nor taken off the other, from me; by thy ſufferings I am fully and for ever freed from the guilt and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin; by mine own corruptions I am

               <p>How fearfull ought this to make me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin? how carefull to avoid occaſions of allurements to it? how thankfull, how joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to receive Gods Fatherly chaſtiſements for it? I may here ſee, and joyfully admire, the wiſedome, juſtice; goodneſſe, mercy, of my heavenly Father; his juſtice, in puniſhing ſin; his wiſedome, in the proportion and end of this puniſhment; his goodneſſe, by ſuſteining me under it, by redeeming me from it; his mercy, by making it to work for me a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and eternall weight of glory.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 25. <hi>Upon Mans ſinfull frailtie in the hour of Temptation, with motives to make reſiſtance.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Am now in the liſts with Satan, and this hour to fight the Lords battail: God ſeeth me, and his holy Angels ſee me, I have long profeſſed my ſelf to be Chriſts ſouldier, and he hath now brought me to the field to prove me, now is the triall of my courage, of my Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; if I overcome, I ſhall rejoyce on earth, triumph in heaven.</p>
               <p>If that evill one were as powerfull as mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, I had juſt cauſe to fear him; but now my comfort and aſſurance is, that he cannot hurt me, but by me: He now ſtrongly labours to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline my will (and wo were me if he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it) his ſubtile ſuggeſtions, his unclean ſolicitations, his fulminated motions, may be the father begetting, but mine own corrupt heart is the mother conceiving; there can be no danger from abroad, if there be no treaſon at home.</p>
               <p>Look well into thy ſelf therefore O my ſoul, aſcend the Watch tower of thine underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſee that there lurk therein no ſeeming ſhews, no ſpecious pretences, no groſs lies, no falſe propoſals to betray thee; if thy head be ſurpriſed, thy heart cannot long hold out.</p>
               <p>Examine thine affections, try them by the bleſſed rule of divine precepts, if they be not ſharply corrected, they will ſoon be corrupted; endeavour to reſiſt the very firſt motions to ſin;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170052:56"/>for if Satan can beguile thine affections, he will undoubtedly command thine actions.</p>
               <p>Quicken thy memory by the momentany plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſin, by the heavy judgements threatned againſt it, by the ſad conſequences of it, by the eternity of torments after it: Think how often thou haſt been allready foyled; how many ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vows and faithfull promiſes thou haſt all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made to God of thine amendment; how careleſly thou haſt diſpenſed with them all, and how preſumptuouſly perſiſted in thy follies: O think how gracious thy God hath been unto thee in forbearing, how wonderfull his mercy is in pardoning, how juſtly he might now deſtroy thee, even in the very act of ſinning.</p>
               <p>Lord, if none of all this will yet ſcare me from ſinning againſt thee, nor allure me to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I may draw nearer home unto thee: O let me yet confider who it is that leadeth me to fight, and wherefore I have engaged. Thou, O my bleſſed Saviour, art my Captain, and Heaven is my Country; Shall I now loſe thoſe rivers of eternall pleaſures, for this ſhort, this falſe, this momentany joy? ſhall I run from thee who art the Prince of Peace, and who haſt ſpilt thy pretious blood for me, unto that cruel enemy of Mankind, who hath drawn ſo much blood from me? Shall I forſake thee who haſt layd down thy life for me, and inſlave my ſelf to him who every minute ſeeketh to devour me? Shall I diſhonor thee my God, grieve thine holy Angels, ſhame my profeſſion, wound mine own conſcience, terrifie mine own ſoul, ſeek mine own ruin? If I conſent to this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God whom I diſhonour will abhor me, thoſe bleſſed Angels whom I grieve will forſake me, thoſe curſed ſpirits whom I obey
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170052:57"/>will deride me, that conſcience which I now wound will accuſe me, that glorious Goſpel which I ſhame will condemn me, and that ruin which I now ſeek will for ever ſeize upon me.</p>
               <p>Let this move thee (O my ſoul) as thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteſt happineſs, to take up a bleſſed reſolution of reſiſtance: If the aſſault diſmay thee, let the conqueſt encourage thee; if the beginning be ſharp, the cloſe will be ſweet; if nature be dejected, grace will be ſtrengthened; and as grace increaſeth here, ſo ſhall glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Conſider laſt of all what Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, and fix it in thy thoughts as chief of all, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tryed he ſhall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him,</hi> Jam. 1.12. Thrice happy is that ſoul which is faithfull in Gods ſervice, although it may often faint, it ſhall never fail; it may ſometimes be foyled, but ſhall never be overcome; it ſhall never fall totally, it can never fall finally; for thou, Lord, upholdeſt it, and in thy love it is ſure of ſafety here, of triumph here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

               <p>WIth grief of heart I confeſs, that I find a Law in my members, rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of my mind, and leading me captive to the Law of fin, ſo that thoſe things which I would do I cannot, and I dayly and hourly do thoſe things which I would not; yet my comfort is, that I make not proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof: By the weakneſs of mine own corruptions, I often fall into ſin, but by the bleſſed aſſiſtance of thy grace I abhor to lie there; ſin oftentimes ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170052:58"/>me, but by thy rich mercy hath never yet reigned over me; It hath often deceived me, but I truſt ſhall never deſtroy me. It hath pleaſed thee, O my bleſſed Saviour, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all things under ſin, that thy grace may abound; while I ſtrive againſt it, and am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for it, my ſinfull deſires will (I truſt) be graciouſly accepted, and (in thy perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) gloriouſly rewarded.</p>
               <p>Be not diſmayed therefore, O my ſoul, that thou ſometimes art raviſhed with apprehenſion of thy heavenly joyes, and ſuddenly relapſed to the follies of a wretched heart; the one thou happily enjoyeſt, by the ſweet aſſiſtance of the heavenly Spirit; the other thou violently ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, by the ſtrong torrent of my ſinfull nature. Lord, ſuch is thy great wiſdom, and inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable goodneſs towards me, that oftentimes thou leaveſt me unto my ſelf, and therefore ſuffereſt me to fall (and that moſt grievouſly ſometimes) that I may ſee mine own infirmities, and be truly humbled for them; that I may impute nothing to mine own merits, but give all the glory to thy ſufferings; that I may goe out of my ſelf, and mine own miſery, into the ſweet enjoyment of thy rich, and endleſſe mercy.</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore, O my ſoul, that ſo long as thou continueſt in this valley of tears, thou canſt not live without this burthen of ſin; ſo long as thou carrieſt this frail body about thee, continuing weakneſſes will be attending on thee. O let this teach thee to bewail the miſery of this frail life, which is onely prone to evill, and that continually; let it humble thee for thy many failings, and invite thee to a more hearty and ſincere affection to thy Saviour, by

               <p>Lord, how truly bleſſed is the condition of thy Saints? who compelleſt even the rage of earth and hell to work for their advantage: <hi>Why art thou then ſo ſad, O my Soul, and why art thou ſo diſquieted within me? ſtill truſt in God, for he is the help of thy countenance, and thy God,</hi> Pſal. 42.15.</p>

               <p>WHile I am in this pilgrimage of ſin, I cannot be without this portion of ſorrow, why complain I of that which I have ſo juſtly deſerved? how often hath my God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me the gracious viſits of his bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? and yet how eaſily have I regarded them? Lord, I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy mercies, much leſſe of this invaluable favour, to enjoy the kiſſes of thy ſacred mouth; as I am now grieved for the loſſe of thy preſence, ſo I have too often grieved thee by mine own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious abſence; this is the ſad condition even of the beſt of thy Saints in this life; as they have had their aberrations from grace, ſo they have had their fluctuations in woe; theſe ſad departings of thy bleſſed Spirit have ever been the juſt memorials of their preſent griefs, and former miſeries.</p>

Hath God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to be gratious? hath he ſhut up his tender mercy in diſpleaſure?</hi> Pſal. 77.7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>How grievous was this complaint? how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious thine anſwer? even in the very minute of diſtreſſe, even by the very lips of the diſtreſſed; for it follows in a breath, <hi>And I ſaid, this is my death, but I will remember the years of the right hand of the moſt High.</hi>

               <p>Lord, if thou giveſt me but the leaſt meaſure of true faith, I ſhall be able to remove the greateſt mountains of ſin, and know aſſuredly, to my ſouls exceeding comfort, that thou hideſt thy face from me but for a moment in this life, that thou mayſt gather me to everlaſting kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in that to come.</p>
               <p>Comfort thy ſelf in this therefore (O my Soul) that God will never leave thee, that he will never forſake thee, that he will never leave thee totally, nor forſake thee finally; that he hath not now withdrawn his gratious preſence from thee, but the preſent comfort of his grace from working in thee: as there are ſad deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo there will undoubtedly be gratious

               <p>Lord, if my hopes of heaven were grounded on the weak foundation of mine own abilityes, If mine Election were but temporary, I might juſtly fear this deſertion would prove eternall; but now my comfort is, that Chriſt is my ſtrong rock, on whom I am ſafely built; that nothing can ſeparate me from his love; that his Decree of mine Election is particular, ſweet, ſure, and eternal; that the happy means appointed to this bleſſed end, is faith, holineſs, righteouſneſs, and ſanctification; holineſs to obey thy precepts, ſaith to embrace thy promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, righteouſneſs to enjoy thy Saints, and ſanctification to poſſeſs my ſelf: Thy bleſſed Decree (O Lord) is ſo far from giving me li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to commit ſin, that it moſt undoubtedly reſtrains me from it; If I cannot make my calling and election ſure, by thy decreed means of ſanctification, I ſhall never make my comfort ſure by my vain hopes of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>If I look upon <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Jonah, Chriſt</hi> himſelf, I ſhall there ſee the ſeveral and the ſorrowfull degrees of this Deſertion: <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> fearfully ſinning, <hi>David</hi> a long time reſting in ſin, and wofully deprived of Gods gracious preſence for ſin; <hi>Jonah,</hi> even doubting of Gods favour, in the ſuddenneſs, and the ſharpneſs of his puniſhment; and thou, O my bleſſed Saviour, affrighted with the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170052:61"/>fierceneſs of thy Fathers wrath for ſin, and for a time (as thou wert man) deſpairing of his gracious prefence.</p>
               <p>Be not afraid therefore, O my ſoul; for as thou art deferted for thy ſins ſake, ſo thou art beloved for thy Saviours ſake; though he <hi>hide himſelf behind the wall</hi> (of thy corruption) yet he will graciouſly <hi>look through the lattice</hi> (of thine humiliation) <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.9: Even this thy preſent ſadneſs will afford thee ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſome gracious glimpſes of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and though thy heart be now diſquieted within thee, thou ſhalt again aſſuredly receive the voice of joy and gladneſs.

               <p>HOW much art thou miſtaken (O my Soul) to think thy ſelf then fartheſt off from God, when thou art neareſt unto him; to ſuppoſe thy ſelf then moſt wretched, when thou art neareſt to the paths of happineſs? He that never doubted, never truly believed; and he that hath leaſt aſſurance in himſelf, will have moſt certainty in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt ſinned, and thou art ſorrowfull; thou haſt committed great and grievous ſins, and thou abhorreſt them, thou forſakeſt them, thou heartily deſireſt pardon for them; if thou hadſt not a godly ſorrow, thou couldſt not have this godly deſire; if thy ſorrow were for puniſhment, it would cauſe thy death, but now it is for ſin, it will lead thee to repentance; if thou grieveſt not ſo much for the ſevere ſentence of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Judge, as for the diſpleaſure of a good and gratious Father, as thou ſoweſt in tears, thou ſhalt reap in joy, nay thou ſhalt have great joy even in theſe tears, thou ſhalt have much ſweetneſs even in this ſorrow; and if thy ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time be ſweet, how bleſſed will thy harveſt be? hear what thy Saviour ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted;</hi> in ſorrows here, in eternity of joyes hereafter: who can curſe, where God hath bleſſed? what Devill can deject, where God will exalt?</p>
               <p>Thou art grieved for offending thy gratious

               <p>Bleſſed Lord, I now feel, to mine unſpeakable comfort, that thou haſt wounded me with the terrours of thy Law, that thou mayſt heal me with the comforts of thy Goſpell; that I am therefore bruiſed with the burden of my ſins, that I may be ever eaſed by the merits of my Saviours ſufferings; all my imperfections are his, all his righteouſneſs is mine, I may boldly chalenge it, thou wilt not deny it, I may ſafely plead it, thou canſt not refuſe it.</p>
               <p>Conſider yet further, O my Soul, what thy bleſſed Saviour ſaith unto thee, <hi>I am the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall be live; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever

               <p>How canſt thou doubt now (O my Soul) when thy Saviour biddeth thee believe, and live? what canſt thou fear, when thou haſt his promiſe for thy ſafety? Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but not one tittle of his Word ſhall fail.</p>
               <p>Let not the number of thy ſins affright thee, for it is <hi>his bloud which clenſeth us from all iniquity,</hi> 1 Ioh. 1.7, 9.</p>

               <p>I have been too carefully ſolicitous for the things of this life, too careſly negligent of the treaſures in that to come: I have had many wayes to deprive my ſelf of my preſent comfort, of my future happineſs; when my talent hath been large, I have had no leiſure, when little, no ability to works of mercy. The preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of thy Saints have been daily negleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

I have offended thee my God, grieved thy Saints, burdened mine own conſcience, and been an utter enemy to mine own ſalvation.</p>
               <p>As my affections have been frozen towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo have I juſtly found the gifts and graces of thy holy Spirit, decaying daily in mine own ſoul; my love cold to thy law, mine ears deaf to thy precepts, my mouth dumb to thy praiſes; my faith dead to thy promiſes, my hope fainting, my zeal languiſhing, my joy periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <p>NOthing is more common amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans than to be deluded by the ſhew of holy actions; the heart of man is deceitfull above all things, who can know it? holy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances are uſually accompanied with helliſh temptations; when the Ship of our ſoules is under ſail, and hath the freſheſt way for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we have then moſt need to look to our ſteerage, to have an eye to the compaſs and land-marks.</p>
               <p>Which of our holy duties (which are the ſhips we ſayl in to the port of happineſs) have not their rocks to ſplit upon, or Remoraes to hinder them, or croſs winds to divert them, or leaks to ſink them, or ſeas to overwhelm them? when we arrive at any ſmall meaſure of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we many times reſt in it, and grow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure upon it: if grace carry us on farther, we are too apt to beleeve that we are far better than our neighbours, that we are highly in Gods favour, and cannot but deſerve his fatherly protection, his liberall remuneration; and ſo by this ſecret inſinuation of pride in our hearts, wee have folly in our hands,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170052:77"/>ſinne in our mindes, and ſhame in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>That prayer is very rare, that is not fick of ſome diſtemper; that charity very pure, that can admit of no miſtakes, and that performance very perfect, that is not ſoyled with ſome filth of wickedneſs: How willing are our thoughts to wander in our prayers? how cold and careleſs are we in them? and how remils in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them? where is that conſtancy, that fervency, that holy importunity of ſpirit that is required of us in this holy exerciſe? which of us can truly ſay, that (throughout the whole courſe of his whole life hitherto) he ever put up one prayer unto Almighty God, that was not cumbred with diſtracted thoughts, that needed not a preſent pardon? I tremble at mine own, and grieve at others failings (O let my ſevereſt cenſures of my brothers ſins, be aſſured ſigns of my beſt love) How far are we (even the very beſt of us) from that purity, and perfection of ſoul which becometh this holy duty? and yet how ready are we, even the very worſt of us, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve our ſelves ſufficiently holy, aſſuredly happy?</p>
               <p>We content our ſelves uſually with the very ſhels, and husks, and outſides of Religion; with ſhews and ſhadows of devotion; with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary, cold prayers; intermitted, undigeſted readings; careleſs, inconſiderate meditations; hypocritall, phariſaical faſtings; popular Almſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, having onely the ſhew of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof: All theſe, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe are like to theſe, are odious to God, abhominable to good men, and moſt deſtructive to their ſouls that are deluded by them.</p>

                  <hi>Lord,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Have ever been too apt to revenge the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt injuries offered unto me by others, in relation to mine outward condition, and too remiſs in that holy revenge of thoſe great and inſufferable wrongs, which I daily and hourly obtrude upon mine own ſoul; this plainly ſheweth me to have been too much ſavouring of fleſh and blood, too little mindfull of thy kingdom, and the righteouſneſs thereof: That ſoul which is truly ſenſible of its own injury, will (by thy grace) be dayly minding of its own redreſle; and that ſinner which is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſlight offences, will in time become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of greater.</p>
               <p>My greateſt enemies are thoſe of mine own houſhold: The world may allure me, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill perſwade me, but it is mine own falſe heart alone that betrayes me, and mine own corrupt nature that enſlaves me: my greateſt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170052:81"/>care ſhall therefore be, to bend my ſtrongeſt force againſt mine own corruptions; to labour much to ſubdue mine affections, and to take an holy revenge upon my ſinfull actions; not to ſatisfie thy juſtice, but to implore thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that I may thereby truly manifeſt my perfect hatred againſt ſin, and the ſincerity of my ſoul to thy ſervice.</p>
               <p>There need none other motives to invite me to this holy duty, than the wofull breaches ſin hath daily made in my ſoul, ſuch as (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy) will never be repaired; this is too ſadly proved by the ſenſible decay of goodneſſe, and the too powerfull growth of ungodlineſſe in my corrupt heart; as it is eaſie for that Caſtle to ſtand a cloſe ſiege, that is well fortified, man'd and victualled, ſo is it impoſsible for that Fort to hold out long which maketh no reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Lord, as mine own ſpirituall ruins have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been cauſed by mine own neglects, ſo (by thy gratious aſsiſtance) mine own repairs ſhall be begun and finiſhed, by my preſent deſires, and future endeavours. That time which I have loſt by former careleſneſſe, and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Religion, I will endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem by holy vigilance, and Chriſtian forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and that I may ſincerely be what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, with willingneſs of heart, I offer up this ſolemn Vow unto thee: Lord, as this holy motion came from thy heavenly Spirit, ſo enable me to the performance of it, by thy grace, to thy glory, and my ſoules eternall comfort.</p>
               <p>I vow my ſelf a ſerious and profeſſed enemy to all ungodlineſſe; no ſinfull thought ſhall
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170052:82"/>ſurpriſe me without a ſorrowfull ſigh; no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious word paſs me without a ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation, and devout confeſsion; no wicked action defile me without a ſincere and godly humiliation; unto each meaſure of ſin I will allow a due meaſure of ſorrow; thoſe ſins that have been reigning over me, ſhall at ſet houres be conſtantly revenged by me; and as my body hath been a deep ſharer in my ſinnes, ſo it ſhall allſo be a dayly ſharer in my ſufferings: I will at ſet ſeaſons deny my ſelf ſomewhat of theſe outward enjoyments (which thou Lord in mercy haſt allowed me) as a true ſign of my true ſorrow for that ſinfull exceſs which I have too often taken without thine allowance. Thoſe ſinfull houres which have been vainly loſt in idleneſſe and emptineſſe, ſhall be willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly redeemed in a conſtant obſervation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties; no day ſhall paſſe me without a ſolemn and devout task of devotion, no hour without ſome ſweet ejaculation: And when at any time the troubles and diſturbances of this frail life ſhall deny me happy opportunities for theſe heavenly performances, what is wanting in act ſhall be made up in deſire; which thou, Lord, I truſt wilt graciouſly accept, and look upon as done, becauſe faithfully inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

               <p>If it were not truly good, it could never make me truly happy; if not neceſſarily good, I might then enjoy happineſſe without it; if not ſufficiently good, my happineſſe enjoyed by it could not afford me ſatisfaction in it; if not permanently good, what I enjoy in ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, I may want in perfection, by being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly removed from it.
